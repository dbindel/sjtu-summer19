\section{Bias-variance tradeoffs and regularization}

At the end of the last class, we talked about generalization error
for least squares in the presence of noise.  In particular, we saw
that if there is a true linear model $Ax = b$ and we compute an
estimate $A_1 \hat{x} = \hat{b}_1$ involving a subset of the data
with noisy measurements ($\hat{b}_1 = b_1 + e$), then
\[
  \|Ax-A\hat{x}\| \leq \|A A_1^\dagger\| \|e\| \leq \|A\| \|A_1^\dagger\| \|e\|.
\]
We cannot generally overcome the effects of the measurement error,
but we can at least hope not to amplify them.  The amplification factor
$\|A\| \|A_1^\dagger\|$ could be large if $\|A\|$ is large, but a more
common problem is that $\|A_1^\dagger\|$ is large.  In numerical
analysis, we might call this a problem with {\em ill-conditioning};
in statistics, we might refer to this as an issue with
{\em high variance} in the estimator.

More generally, suppose we have $y = f(x) + \epsilon$ where $\epsilon$
is a noise term with mean zero and variance $\sigma^2$, and we use
data $y$ to fit an estimator function $\hat{f}(x)$.  Then for an
unseen point $x$
\[
  \mathbb{E}[(y-\hat{f}(x))^2] =
  \mathbb{E}[\hat{f}(x)-f(x)]^2 +
  \operatorname{Var}[\hat{f}(x)] +
  \sigma^2;
\]
that is, the squared error involves the squared {\em bias} (caused by
inability of the model to fit the function even with perfect data);
the {\em variance} (associated with stability of the estimation
procedure under perturbations from noise); and a term associated
with measurement error.

If we have an ill-conditioned fitting problem (or a high variance
estimator, if you prefer), what should we do?  There are three
options:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Get more data.
\item
  Reduce the noise.
\item
  Change the fitting problem to reduce the ill-conditioning.
\end{enumerate}
Getting more data or reducing the noise is not always practical or
economical, and in any event is an issue unrelated to numerical
methods.  Thus, we will turn now to the last approach:
{\em regularizing} the problem to reduce the ill-conditioning,
possibly at the expense of a small bias.

%\section{Linear and nonlinear least squares}
\section{Factor selection and pivoted QR}

In ill-conditioned problems, the columns of $A$ are nearly linearly
dependent; we can effectively predict some columns as linear
combinations of other columns.  The goal of the column pivoted QR
algorithm is to find a set of columns that are ``as linearly
independent as possible.''  This is not such a simple task,
and so we settle for a greedy strategy: at each step, we select the
column that is least well predicted (in the sense of residual norm)
by columns already selected.  This leads to the {\em pivoted QR
  factorization}
\[
  A \Pi = Q R
\]
where $\Pi$ is a permutation and the diagonal entries of $R$ appear
in descending order (i.e. $r_{11} \geq r_{22} \geq \ldots$).  To
decide on how many factors to keep in the factorization, we either
automatically take the first $k$ or we dynamically choose to take $k$
factors where $r_{kk}$ is greater than some tolerance and
$r_{k+1,k+1}$ is not.

The pivoted QR approach has a few advantages.  It yields {\em
  parsimonious} models that predict from a subset of the columns of
$A$ -- that is, we need to measure fewer than $n$ factors to produce
an entry of $b$ in a new column.  It can also be computed relatively
cheaply, even for large matrices that may be sparse.

\section{Tikhonov}

A second approach is to say that we want a model in which the
coefficients are not too large.  To accomplish this, we add
a penalty term to the usual least squares problem:
\[
  \mbox{minimize } \|Ax-b\|^2 + \lambda^2 \|x\|^2.
\]
Equivalently, we can write
\[
\mbox{minimize } \left\|
\begin{bmatrix} A \\ \lambda I \end{bmatrix} x -
\begin{bmatrix} b \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\right\|^2,
\]
which leads to the regularized version of the normal equations
\[
  (A^T A + \lambda^2 I) x = A^T b.
\]
In some cases, we may want to regularize with a more general
norm $\|x\|_M^2 = x^T M x$ where $M$ is symmetric and positive
definite, which leads to the regularized equations
\[
  (A^T A + \lambda^2 M) x = A^T b.
\]
If we know of no particular problem structure in advance, the
standard choice of $M = I$ is a good default.

It is useful to compare the usual least squares solution to the
regularized solution via the SVD.  If $A = U \Sigma V^T$ is the
economy SVD, then
\begin{align*}
  x_{LS} &= V \Sigma^{-1} U^T b \\
  x_{Tik} &= V f(\Sigma)^{-1} U^T b
\end{align*}
where
\[
  f(\sigma)^{-1} = \frac{\sigma}{\sigma^2 + \lambda^2}.
\]
This {\em filter} of the inverse singular values affects the larger
singular values only slightly, but damps the effect of very small
singular values.

\section{Truncated SVD}

The Tikhonov filter reduces the effect of small singular values on
the solution, but it does not eliminate that effect.  By contrast,
the {\em truncated SVD} approach uses the filter
\[
f(z) =
\begin{cases}
  z, & z > \sigma_{\min} \\
  \infty, & \mbox{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]
In other words, in the truncated SVD approach, we use
\[
  x = V_k \Sigma_k^{-1} U_k^T b
\]
where $U_k$ and $V_k$ represent the leading $k$ columns of $U$ and
$V$, respectively, while $\Sigma_k$ is the diagonal matrix consisting
of the $k$ largest singular values.

\section{$\ell^1$ and the lasso}

An alternative to Tikhonov regularization (based on a Euclidean norm
of the coefficient vector) is an $\ell^1$ regularized problem
\[
  \mbox{minimize } \|Ax-b\|^2 + \lambda \|x\|_1.
\]
This is sometimes known as the ``lasso'' approach.  The $\ell^1$
regularized problem has the property that the solutions tend to
become sparse as $\lambda$ becomes larger.  That is, the $\ell^1$
regularization effectively imposes a factor selection process like
that we saw in the pivoted QR approach.  Unlike the pivoted QR
approach, however, the $\ell^1$ regularized solution cannot be
computed by one of the standard factorizations of numerical linear
algebra.

\section{Tradeoffs and tactics}

All four of the regularization approaches we have described are used
in practice, and each has something to recommend it.  The pivoted QR
approach is relatively inexpensive, and it results in a model that
depends on only a few factors.  If taking the measurements to compute
a prediction costs money --- or even costs storage or bandwidth for
the factor data! --- such a model may be to our advantage.  The
Tikhonov approach is likewise inexpensive, and has a nice Bayesian
interpretation (though we didn't talk about it).  The truncated SVD
approach involves the best approximation rank $k$ approximation to the
original factor matrix, and can be interpreted as finding the $k$ best
factors that are linear combinations of the original measurements.
The $\ell_1$ approach again produces models with sparse coefficients;
but unlike QR with column pivoting, the $\ell_1$ regularized solutions
incorporate information about the vector $b$ along with the matrix $A$.

So which regularization approach should one use?  In terms of
prediction quality, all can provide a reasonable deterrent against
ill-posedness and overfitting due to highly correlated factors.  Also,
all of the methods described have a parameter (the number of retained
factors, or a penalty parameter $\lambda$) that governs the tradeoff
between how well-conditioned the fitting problem will be and the
increase in bias that naturally comes from looking at a smaller class
of models.  Choosing this tradeoff intelligently may be rather more
important than the specific choice of regularization strategy.  A
detailed discussion of how to make this tradeoff is beyond the scope
of the class; but we will see some of the computational tricks
involved in implementing specific strategies for choosing
regularization parameters before we are done.

\section{Iterative methods}

We started with a discussion of {\em direct} methods
for solving least squares problems based on matrix factorizations.
These methods have a well-understood running time, and they produce
a solution that is accurate except for roundoff effects.  For larger
or more complicated problems, though, we turn to
{\em iterative} methods that produce a series of approximation
solutions.

We will turn now to iterative methods: gradient and stochastic
gradient approaches, Newton and Gauss-Newton, and (block) coordinate
descent.  We will see additional solver ideas as we move through the
class, but these are nicely prototypical examples that illustrate
two running themes in the design of numerical methods for
optimization.

\paragraph{Fixed point iterations}
All our nonlinear solvers (and some of our linear solvers) will be
{\em iterative}.  We can write most as {\em fixed point iterations}
\begin{equation}
  x^{k+1} = G(x^k), \label{eq:fixed-point}
\end{equation}
which we hope will converge to a fixed point, i.e. $x^* = G(x^*)$.
We often approach convergence analysis through the
{\em error iteration} relating the error $e^k = x^k-x^*$ at
successive steps:
\begin{equation}
  e^{k+1} = G(x^* + e^k)-G(x^*).
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Model-based methods}
Most nonquadratic problems are too hard to solve directly.  On the other
hand, we can {\em model} hard nonquadratic problems by simpler (possibly
linear) problems as a way of building iterative solvers.  The most
common tactic --- but not the only one! --- is to approximate the
nonlinear function by a linear or quadratic function and apply all the
things we know about linear algebra.  We will return to this idea in
when we discuss Newton-type methods for optimization.

\section{Gradient descent}

One very simple iteration is {\em steepest descent}
or {\em gradient descent}:
\begin{equation} \label{iter:gd}
  x^{k+1} = x^k - \alpha_k \nabla \phi(x^k)
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_k$ is the {\em step size}, chosen adaptively or
with some fixed schedule.

To understand the convergence of this method, consider gradient
descent with a fixed step size $\alpha$ for the quadratic model problem
\[
  \phi(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T A x + b^T x + c
\]
where $A$ is symmetric positive definite.  
We have computed the gradient for a quadratic before:
\[
  \nabla \phi(x) = Ax + b,
\]
which gives us the iteration equation
\[
  x_{k+1} = x_k - \alpha (A x_k + b).
\]
Subtracting the fixed point equation
\[
  x_* = x_* - \alpha (A x_* + b)
\]
yields the error iteration
\[
  e_{k+1} = (I-\alpha A) e_k.
\]
If $\{ \lambda_j \}$ are the eigenvalues of $A$, then the
eigenvalues of $I-\alpha A$ are $\{ 1-\alpha \lambda_j \}$.
The spectral radius of the iteration matrix is thus
\[
  \max \{ |1-\alpha \lambda_j| \}_j =
  \max \left( |1-\alpha \lambda_{\min}|, |1-\alpha \lambda_{\max}| \right).
\]
The iteration converges provided $\alpha < 2/\lambda_{\max}$, and the
optimal $\alpha$ is
\[
  \alpha_* = \frac{2}{\lambda_{\min} + \lambda_{\max}},
\]
which leads to the spectral radius
\[
  1 - \frac{2 \lambda_{\min}}{\lambda_{\min} + \lambda_{\max}} =
  1 - \frac{2}{1 + \kappa(A)}
\]
where $\kappa(A) = \lambda_{\max}/\lambda_{\min}$ is the condition
number for the (symmetric positive definite) matrix $A$.  If $A$
is ill-conditioned, then, we are forced to take very small steps
to guarantee convergence, and convergence may be
heart breakingly slow.  We will get to the minimum in the long run
--- but, then again, in the long run we all die.

\section{The Benefits of Slow Convergence}

How steepest descent behaves on a quadratic model
is how it behaves generally: if $x_*$ is a
strong local minimizer of some general nonlinear $\phi$, then gradient
descent with a small enough step size will converge locally to
$x_*$.  But if $H_{\phi}(x_*)$ is ill-conditioned, then one has to
take small steps, and convergence can be quite slow.

Somewhat surprisingly, sometimes we {\em want} this slow convergence.
To illustrate why, consider the {\em Landweber iteration}, which
is steepest descent iteration applied to linear least squares
problems:
\[
  x^{k+1} = x^k - \alpha_k A^T (Ax^k-b).
\] 
If we start from the initial guess $x^0 = 0$ and let the step size
be a fixed value $\alpha_k = \alpha$, we have the subsequent steps
\begin{align*}
  x^1 &= \alpha A^T b \\
  x^2 &= (I-\alpha A^T A) \alpha A^T b + \alpha A^T b \\
  x^3 &= (I-\alpha A^T A)^2 \alpha A^T b +
         (I-\alpha A^T A) \alpha A^T b +
         \alpha A^T b
\end{align*}
and so forth.
That is, each step is a partial sum of a {\em Neumann series},
which is the matrix generalization of the geometric series
\[
  \sum_{j=0}^k z^j = (1-z^{k+1})(1-z)^{-1} \rightarrow (1-z)^{-1}
  \mbox{ as } k \rightarrow \infty \mbox{ for } |z| < 1.
\]
Using the more concise expression for the partial sums of the
Neumann series expansion, we have
\begin{align*}
  x^{k+1}
  &= \sum_{j=0}^k (I-\alpha A^TA)^j \alpha A^T b \\
  &= (I-(I-\alpha A^TA)^{k+1}) (\alpha A^TA)^{-1} \alpha A^T b \\
  &= (I-(I-\alpha A^TA)^{k+1}) A^\dagger b.
\end{align*}
Alternately, we can write the iterates in terms of the singular value
decomposition with a filter for regularization:
\[
x^{k+1} = V \tilde{\Sigma}^{-1} U^T b, \quad
\tilde{\sigma}_j^{-1} = (1-(1-\alpha \sigma_j^2)^{k+1})) \sigma_j^{-1}.
\]
Hence, rather than running the Landweber iteration to convergence,
we typically stop when $k$ is large enough so that the filter is
nearly the identity for large singular values, but is small enough
so that the influence of the small singular values is suppressed.

\section{Gradient descent with errors}

Before we turn to stochastic gradient descent, let us instead look at
how to analyze {\em gradient descent with errors}.  In particular,
consider the iteration
\[
  x^{k+1} = x^k - \alpha_k p^k
\]
where
\[
  p^k = \nabla \phi(x^k) + u^k
\]
for some error $u^k$ that is ``small.''  As before, let's keep things
simple by looking how this iteration behaves for a quadratic model
problem with a fixed step size, i.e.
\[
  x^{k+1} = x^k - \alpha (Ax^k + b + u^k).
\]
Subtracting $x^*$ from both sides gives the error iteration
\[
  e^{k+1} = (I-\alpha A) e^k - \alpha u^k.
\]  
A little mumbling over the iteration gives us
\[
  e^{k+1} = (I-\alpha A)^{k+1} e^0 - \alpha \sum_{j=0}^k (I-\alpha A)^{k-j} u^j.
\]

In order to analyze the second term in this iteration, we need some
additional sort of control.  In the simplest case, that control might
be deterministic.  For example, if we can guarantee that
$\|u^k\| \leq C \gamma^{-k}$, then we have the bound
\[
  \left\| \sum_{j=0}^k  (I-\alpha A)^{k-j} u_j \right\| \leq
  C \gamma^{-k} \sum_{j=0}^k \left( \gamma \|(I-\alpha A)\|\right)^{k-j} \leq
  \frac{C \gamma^{-k-1}}{1-\gamma \|I-\alpha A\|}.
\]
Hence, we can make the iteration converge with inaccurate gradients,
as long as the accuracy improves sufficiently quickly with time.

We will pick up this iteration again next time under the assumption
that the errors are random, which is what happens in the
{\em stochastic gradient} method.
