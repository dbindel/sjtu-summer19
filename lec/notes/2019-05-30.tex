\section{Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)}

In the last lecture, we considered low rank approximations to data
matrices.  We started with the ``optimal'' rank $k$ approximation
to $A \in \bbR^{m \times n}$ via the SVD, then moved on to
approximations that represent $A$ in terms of the rows and columns of
$A$ rather than in terms of the left and right singular vectors.
We argued that while these latter factorizations may not minimize the
Frobenius norm of the error for a given rank, they are easier to
interpret because they are expressed in terms of the factors in the
original data set.  We continue with our theme of finding
interpretable factorizations today by looking at
{\em non-negative matrix factorizations} (NMF).

Let $\bbR_+$ denote the non-negative real numbers; for a non-negative
data matrix $A \in \bbR_+^{m \times n}$, we seek
\[
  A \approx WH, \quad \mbox{ where }
  W \in \bbR_+^{m \times k}, 
  H \in \bbR_+^{k \times n}.
\]
Non-negative matrix factorizations are convenient because they express
the columns of $A$ (the data) in terms of positively weighted sums of
the columns of $W$, which we interpret as ``parts.''  This type of
decomposition into parts makes sense in many different domains; for
example:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l|l}
    Meaning of columns of $A$ & Meaning of columns of $W$
    \\ \hline
    Word distributions for documents &
    Word distributions for topics
    \\
    Pictures of faces &
    Pictures of facial features
    \\
    Connections to friends &
    Communities \\
    Spectra of chemical mixtures &
    Spectra of component molecules
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
Unfortunately, non-negative matrix factorizations are generally much
more difficult to compute than the factorizations we considered in the
last lecture.  There are three fundamental difficulties:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  We do not know how big $k$ must be to get a ``good'' representation.
  Compare this to ordinary factorization, where we can hope for error
  bounds in terms of $\sigma_{k+1}, \ldots, \sigma_{\min(m,n)}$.
\item
  The optimization problem is non-convex, and there may generally be
  many local minima.  Again, compare this with the optimal
  approximation problem solved by singular value decomposition, which
  has saddle points, but has no local minimizers that are not also
  global minimizers.
\item
  NMF is not {\em incremental}: the best rank $k$ approximation may
  have little to do with the best rank $k+1$ approximation.  Again,
  we can compare with the unconstrained problem, for which
  the best rank $k+1$ approximation is a rank-one update to the best
  rank $k$ approximation.
\end{itemize}
Faced with this hard optimization problem, we consider two tactics.
First, we might seek efficient optimization methods that at least
converge to a local minimizer\footnote{%
  In most cases, we can only show convergence to a stationary point,
  but we are likely to converge to a minimizer for almost all initial
  guesses.};
we will spend the first part of the lecture discussing this approach.
Second, we might seek common special cases where we can prove
something about the approximation.  In particular, the NMF problem
is much more tractable when we make a {\em separability} assumption
which is appropriate in some applications.

\section{Going with gradients}

\subsection{Projected gradient descent}

We begin with the {\em projected gradient descent} algorithm for
minimizing a function $\phi$ subject to simple constraints.
Let $\calP(x)$ be a projection function that maps $x$ to the
nearest feasible point; in the case of a simple non-negativity
constraint, $\calP(x) = [x]_+$ is the elementwise maximum of $x$ and
zero.  The projected gradient descent iteration is then
\[
  x^{k+1} = \calP\left( x^{k+1} - \alpha_k \nabla \phi(x^k) \right).
\]
The convergence properties of projected gradient descent are similar
to those of the unprojected version: we can show reliable
convergence for convex (or locally convex) functions and sufficiently
short step sizes, though ill-conditioning may make the convergence slow.

In order to write the gradient for the NMF objective without
descending into a morass of indices, it is helpful to introduce
the {\em Frobenius inner product}: for matrices
$X, Y \in \bbR^{m \times n}$,
\[
  \langle X, Y \rangle_F =
  \sum_{i,j} y_{ij} x_{ij} =
  \tr(Y^T X).
\]
The Frobenius inner product is the inner product associated with the
Frobenius norm: $\|X\|_F^2 = \langle X, X \rangle_F$, and we can apply
the usual product rule for differentiation to compute directional
derivatives of $\phi(W,H) = \|A-WH\|_F^2/2$ with respect to $W$ and $H$:
\begin{align*}
  \delta \phi
  &= \delta \left[ \frac{1}{2} \langle A-WH, A-WH \rangle_F \right] \\
  &= \langle \delta(A-WH), A-WH \rangle_F \\
  &= -\langle (\delta W) H, A-WH \rangle_F
     -\langle W (\delta H), A-WH \rangle_F.
\end{align*}
We let $R = A-WH$, and use the fact that the trace of a product
of matrices is invariant under cyclic permutations of the matrices:
\begin{align*}
  \langle (\delta W) H, R \rangle_F
  & = \tr(H^T (\delta W)^T R)
    = \tr((\delta W)^T RH^T)
    = \langle \delta W, RH^T \rangle_F \\
  \langle W (\delta H), R \rangle_F
  &= \tr((\delta H)^T W^T R) = \langle \delta H, W^T R \rangle_F.
\end{align*}
Therefore, the projected gradient descent iteration for this
problem is
\begin{align*}
  W^{\mathrm{new}} &=
  \left[
    W + \alpha RH^T 
  \right]_+ \\
  H^{\mathrm{new}} &=
  \left[
    H + \alpha W^T R
  \right]_+,
\end{align*}
where in the interest of legibility we have suppressed the iteration
index on the right hand side.

\subsection{Multiplicative updates}

One of the earliest and most popular NMF solvers is the
{\em multiplicative update} scheme of Lee and Seung.  This has the
form of a {\em scaled} gradient descent iteration where we
replace the uniform step size $\alpha_k$ with a different
(non-negative) step size for each entry of $W$ and $H$:
\begin{align*}
  W^{\mathrm{new}} &=
  \left[
    W + S \odot \left( AH^T - W H H^T \right)
  \right]_+ \\
  H^{\mathrm{new}} &=
  \left[
    H + S' \odot \left( W^T A - W^T W H \right)
  \right]_+,  
\end{align*}
where $\odot$ denotes elementwise multiplication.
We similarly let $\oslash$ to denote elementwise division
to define the nonnegative scaling matrices
\[
  S  = W \oslash (WHH^T), \quad
  S' = H \oslash (W^TWH).
\]
With these choices, two of the terms in the summation cancel, so that
\begin{align*}
  W^{\mathrm{new}} &= S  \odot (AH^T) = W \oslash (WHH^T) \odot (AH^T) \\
  H^{\mathrm{new}} &= S' \odot (W^TA) = H \oslash (W^TWH) \odot (W^TA).
\end{align*}
At each step of the Lee and Seung scheme, we scale the (non-negative)
elements of $W$ and $H$ by non-negative factors, yielding a
non-negative result.  There is no need for a non-negative projection
because the step sizes are chosen increasingly conservatively as
elements of $W$ and $H$ approach zero.  But because the steps are
very conservative, the Lee and Seung algorithm may require a large
number of steps to converge.

\section{Coordinate descent}

The {\em (block) coordinate descent} method (also known as
{\em block relaxation} or {\em nonlinear Gauss-Seidel}) for solving
\[
  \mbox{minimize } \phi(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_p)
  \mbox{ for } x_i \in \Omega_i
\]
involves repeatedly optimizing with respect to one coordinate at a
time.  In the basic method, we iterate through each $i$ and compute
\[
  x_i^{k+1} =
  \operatorname{argmin}_\xi \phi(x_1^{k+1}, \ldots, x_{i-1}^{k+1}, \xi,
                                 x_{i+1}^k, \ldots, x_p^k).
\]
The individual subproblems are often simpler than the full problem.
If each subproblem has a unique solution (e.g.~if each subproblem is
strongly convex), the iteration converges to a stationary
point\footnote{
  For non-convex problems, we may converge to a saddle; as an example,
  consider simple coordinate descent
  for $\phi(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 + 4 x_1 x_2 + x_2^2$.
}; this is the situation for all the iterations we will discuss.

\subsection{Simple coordinate descent}

Perhaps the simplest coordinate descent algorithm for NMF sweeps
through all entries of $W$ and $H$.  Let $R = A-WH$; then for the
$(i,j)$ coordinate of $W$, we compute the update
$w_{ij} = w_{ij} + s$ where $s$ minimizes the quadratic
\[
\frac{1}{2} \|A-(W+se_i e_j^T) H\|_F^s =
\frac{1}{2} \|R\|_F^2 -
s \langle (e_i e_j^T) , RH^T \rangle_F +
\frac{1}{2} s^2 \|e_i e_j^T H\|_F^2,
\]
subject to the constraint that $s \geq -w_{ij}$.  The solution to
this optimization is
\[
  s = \max\left( -w_{ij}, \frac{(RH^T)_{ij}}{(HH^T)_{jj}} \right).
\]
Therefore, the update for $w_{ij}$ is
\[
  s = \max\left( -w_{ij}, \frac{(RH^T)_{ij}}{(HH^T)_{jj}} \right), \quad
  w_{ij} := w_{ij} + s, \quad
  R_{i,:} := R_{i,:} - s H_{j,:}
\]
A similar computation for the elements of $H$ gives us the update formulas
\begin{align*}
  s = \max\left( -h_{ij}, \frac{(W^TR)_{ij}}{(W^TW)_{ii}} \right), \quad
  h_{ij} := h_{ij} + s, \quad
  R_{:,j} := R_{:,j} - s W_{:,i}.
\end{align*}
Superficially, this looks much like projected gradient descent with
scaled step lengths.  However, where in gradient descent (or the
multiplicative updates of Lee and Seung) the updates for all entries
of $W$ and $H$ are independent, in this coordinate descent algorithm
we only have independence of updates for a single column of $W$ or a
single row of $H$.  This is a disadvantage for efficient implementation.

\subsection{HALS/RRI}

The simple algorithm in the previous algorithm relaxed on each element
of $W$ and $H$ independently.  In the
{\em hierarchical alternating least squares} or
{\em rank-one residual iteration}, we treat the problem as consisting
of $2k$ vector blocks, one for each column of $W$ and row of $H$.
To update a column $W_{:,j} := W_{:,j} + u$, we must solve the least
squares problem
\[
  \mbox{minimize } \|R-u H_{j,:}\|_F^2 \mbox{ s.t.~} u \geq -W_{:,j},
\]
which is equivalent to solving the independent {\em single variable}
least squares problems
\[
  \mbox{minimize } \|R_{i,:}-u_i H_{j,:}\|_2^2 \mbox{~s.t.~} u_i \geq -w_{ij}.
\]
The $u_i$ must satisfy the normal equations unless it hits the bound
constraint; thus,
\[
  u_i
  = \max\left( -w_{ij}, \frac{R_{i,:} H_{j,:}^T}{H_{j,:} H_{j,:}^T}
    \right)
  = \max\left( -w_{ij}, \frac{(RH^T)_{ij}}{(HH^T)_{jj}} \right).    
\]
Thus, updating a column of $W$ at a time is {\em equivalent} to
updating each of the elements in the column in sequence in
scalar coordinate descent.  The same is true when we update row
of $H$.

\subsection{ANLS}

The alternating non-negative least squares (ANLS) iteration updates
all of $W$ together, then all of $H$:
\begin{align*}
  W & := \operatorname{argmin}_{W \geq 0} \|A-WH\|_F^2 \\
  H & := \operatorname{argmin}_{H \geq 0} \|A-WH\|_F^2
\end{align*}
We can solve for each row of $W$ (or column of $H$) independently by
solving a {\em non-negative least squares problem}.  Unfortunately,
these non-negative least squares problems cannot be solved in a
simple closed form!

The non-negative least squares problem has the general form
\[
  \mbox{minimize } \|Ax-b\|^2 \mbox{ such that } x \geq 0;
\]
it is a convex optimization problem that can be solved using any
constrained optimization solver.  An old class of solvers for this
problem is the {\em active set} methods.  To derive these methods,
we partition the variables into a free set $\mathcal{I}$ and a
constrained set $\mathcal{J}$, and rewrite the KKT equations in the form
\begin{align*}
  x_{\mathcal{I}} &= A_{\mathcal{I}}^\dagger b &
  x_{\mathcal{I}} & \geq 0 \\
  A_{\mathcal{J}}^T (Ax-b) & \geq 0 &
  x_{\mathcal{J}} & = 0.
\end{align*}
If the partitioning into $\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathcal{J}$ is known,
we can compute $x$ via an ordinary least squares solve.  The
difficult part is to figure out which variables are free!
The simplest approach is to guess $\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathcal{J}$
and then iteratively improve the guess by moving one variable at a
time between the two sets as follows.  Starting from an initial
non-negative guess $x$, $\mathcal{I}$, $\mathcal{J}$, we
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute $p = A_{\mathcal{I}}^\dagger b - x$.
\item Compute a new point $x := x + \alpha p$ where $\alpha \leq 1$
  is chosen to be as large as possible subject to non-negativity of
  the new point.
\item If $\alpha < 1$, we move the index for whatever component became
  zero from the $\mathcal{I}$ set to the $\mathcal{J}$ set and
  compute another step.
\item If $\alpha = 1$ and $g_{\mathcal{J}} = A_{\mathcal{J}}^T (Ax-b)$
  has any negative elements, we move the index associated with the
  most negative element of $r_{\mathcal{J}}$ from the $\mathcal{J}$
  set to the $\mathcal{I}$ set and compute another step.
\item Otherwise, we have $\alpha = 1$ and $g_{\mathcal{J}} \geq 0$.
  In this case, the KKT conditions are satisfied, and we may
  terminate.
\end{itemize}
The problem with this approach is that we only change our guess
at the free variables by adding or removing one variable per
iteration.  If our initial guess is not very good, it may take many
iterations to converge.  Alternate methods are more aggressive about
changing the free variable set (or, equivalently, the active
constraint set).

\section{Separable NMF}

In the general case, non-negative matrix factorization is a hard
problem.  However, there are special cases where it becomes easier,
and these are worth exploring.  In a {\em separable} problem, we
can compute
\[
  \Pi^T A = \begin{bmatrix} I \\ W_2 \end{bmatrix} H;
\]
that is, every row of $A$ can be expressed as a positively-weighted
combination of $k$ columns of $A$.  Examples where we might see this
include:
\begin{itemize}
\item In topic modeling, we might have ``anchor words'' that are
  primarily associated with just one topic.
\item In image decomposition, we might have ``pure pixels'' that are
  active for just one part of an image.
\item In chemometrics, we might see that a component molecule
  produces a spike at a unique frequency that is not present for other
  components.
\end{itemize}
Assuming that this separability condition occurs, how are we to find
the $k$ rows of $A$ that go into $H$?  What we will do is to compute
the normalized matrix $\bar{A}$ by scaling each row of $A$ so that it
sums to 1.  With this normalization, all rows of $\bar{A}$ are
positively weighted combinations of the anchor rows
{\em where the weights sum to 1}; that is, if we view each row as a
point in $m$-dimensional space, then the anchor rows are points
on the convex hull.  As discussed in the last lecture, we can find
the convex hull with the pivoted QR algorithm.
\[
  \bar{A}^T \Pi = QR.
\]
Variants of this approach also work for {\em nearly} separable problems.
