\paragraph*{1: How many factors?}
The (economy) pivoted QR factorization is used for factor selection
least squares; we compute
\[
  A \Pi = QR
\]
and then only fit based on the first $k$ columns of $\Pi$.
Given $Q$ and $b$, write a code to compute the mean LOOCV statistic
\[
  \mbox{LOOCV} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m r_{(-i)}^2
\]
for $k = 1, \ldots, n$.  Ideally, your code should take $O(mn)$ time.

{\em Note:} You really do only need $Q$ and $b$!

\paragraph*{2: Maximum likelihood for least squares}
Consider the statistical model
\[
  y = Ax + e
\]
where $e \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)$.  Derive the maximum
likelihood estimates for $x$ and $\sigma^2$ given observed data $y$.
